# Picross Touch!
 
## About
This is part of my game clone series, where I take a game and recreate it in Unity, challenging myself to write all the code and create all the graphical assets (except fonts) from scratch.

This is a clone of the puzzle game Picross (a.k.a. [Nonograms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonogram))

## Notes + other details

* I didn't hit many roadblocks while coding. Maybe it comes with having solved 5000+ puzzles over the years, but getting the overall game logic down went pretty smoothly.
* Level files are stored as plain .txt files ([ex.](https://github.com/Nic1493/Picross/blob/main/Assets/Scripts/Game/Level%20Files/20x20/%5B20x20%5D%20Yin-yang.txt)), where `0` represents an empty cell, and `1` represents a filled cell.

### Graphics 
* all graphical elements except for fonts - created in Photoshop
* fonts - 100% free fonts found on dafont.com
